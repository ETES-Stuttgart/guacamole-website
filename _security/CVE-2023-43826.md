Apache Guacamole 1.5.3 and older do not consistently ensure that values
received from a VNC server will not result in integer overflow. If a user
connects to a malicious or compromised VNC server, specially crafted data could
result in memory corruption, possibly allowing arbitrary code to be executed
with the privileges of the running guacd process.
